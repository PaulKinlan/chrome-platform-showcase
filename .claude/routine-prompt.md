You build per-feature demos for the chrome-platform-showcase project. Every run picks up where the
previous run left off and keeps building features that are **pending (no demo) OR incomplete (a thin
demo)**, committing and pushing after each one. There is NO small per-run cap; the goal is to
eventually have a deep, correct, comprehensive demo for every feature across every release.

**This routine must run correctly standalone — treat every rule below as load-bearing.** It fires
once a day with no human in the loop, so robustness is the whole point: research each feature deeply
(Step 5c), build every distinct use case, and pass the full anti-regression gate (Step 8) before you
push. **Depth beats throughput** — a shallow or wrong demo is worse than an unbuilt one, because the
site is live. If you can only do two features properly in the budget, do two properly.

This is NOT an issue-first flow. Per-feature work goes straight to code. Only the per-release Uber
demo uses an issue gate.

## CRITICAL RULES

Rules that must never be broken. Each has bitten the project before:

1. **Slug source**: Slug the feature using the `name` field returned by the milestone listing
   (`/api/v0/features?milestone=N`), NOT the `name` field returned by the per-feature detail
   endpoint (`/api/v0/features/<id>`). They can differ. The listing's name is what the server uses
   when checking whether a folder exists.
2. **Milestone gating**: Only place a feature under `v<N>/` if it appears in `features_by_type` for
   `milestone=N`. Do not infer the milestone from `browsers.chrome.desktop`, `shipping_year`, or
   anything else. The listing is authoritative.
3. **Colour contrast**: Use CSS variables from public/styles.css. Do not write raw hex codes for
   text or background. Every text-on-background pair must hit WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large
   text). See "Colour and contrast" below.
4. **No fake simulations when a working path exists**: Do not ship a demo that merely simulates,
   mocks, pretends, or animates the API if the browser can make a real call, if a Deno route can
   expose the real header/network behavior, or if a real feature-detection probe can show the
   outcome. A fallback may explain unsupported/flag-required state, but it must be labelled as a
   fallback and must not report "success" as if the platform feature ran.
5. **Browser verification, with a real fallback**: Before pushing a demo, verify it in a real
   Chrome. In a LOCAL session use `chrome-devtools-mcp` (open the route, click/type/drag every
   control, verify the DOM/live readout changes, inspect console/network). In the CLOUD routine (no
   chrome-devtools-mcp) use headless Chrome via Bash + `Read` the screenshot — see "Toolset &
   verification environment" above. Either way, actually load the page and inspect the rendered
   result and console; never claim a browser-verified result you did not produce, and never
   substitute a mere DOM dump for the visual gate.
6. **Accessibility is a release goal**: Every demo must be keyboard-operable and expose meaningful
   semantics. Controls need accessible names/labels, visible focus, native elements where possible,
   correct roles/states when ARIA is needed, and text or live-region equivalents for visual state
   changes. During `chrome-devtools-mcp` verification, inspect the accessibility tree for custom
   controls, visual-only state, canvas/SVG output, and any ARIA you add.
7. **Runtime evidence beats static claims**: A demo is not done until DevTools-backed runtime
   evidence shows it works. Capture initial and post-interaction screenshots when the UI is visual,
   inspect console and network failures, verify that live output/state changed after the primary
   interaction, and check `/telemetry/demo/events` for errors/assertion failures from the page.
8. **In-page assertions for expected behavior**: Where a demo has a primary action or critical state
   transition, call `window.showcaseTelemetry?.assert(id, condition, details)` from the page after
   the action. If a user-media, permission, network, policy, or hardware-gated demo cannot complete,
   assert the fallback branch explicitly and do not label it as a pass.
9. **Research the feature deeply BEFORE writing a probe — most recurring defects are
   shallow-research defects.** Do not build from the chromestatus summary alone. Before any concept:
   (a) FOLLOW every link on the chromestatus detail (spec, explainer, initial proposal, docs,
   samples) and read them — the exact IDL member, CSS grammar, enum vocabulary, and the real
   use-case list are almost always on those pages, not in the summary. (b) Enumerate the feature's
   DISTINCT use cases from that reading; that list sets the concept count. (c) Do follow-on searches
   (MDN, web.dev, WPT) for more use cases and gotchas. (d) Ground it in the REAL implementation —
   search Chromium source, issues, and open CLs (see Step 5c). The probe you write must call the
   EXACT surface the spec names; a demo that exercises the wrong API is the single most common
   review-round bug.
10. **Do not reproduce these confirmed past regressions (each shipped at least once and was
    reverted).** A probe MUST be able to return false — no `|| true`, no never-throwing
    `addEventListener`-as-detection, no treating an ignored unknown dictionary member or a bare
    constructor as full support; probe the exact method/property the interaction uses. Read the
    CURRENT capability enum from live docs and log the browser's ACTUAL returned value — never
    bucket a new value (e.g. `available`) into an old unsupported branch (e.g. a page that only
    knows `readily`). Never derive behaviour/support from the `navigator.userAgent` version, and
    never tell the user to "upgrade to Chrome N" without ruling out flag / origin-trial /
    model-or-language download / hardware / permission / secure-context / policy. Never let an
    unsupported fallback look like native success (especially gradient/content fill). Avoid
    host-global collisions (`top`, `animate`, …) and quote/`</script>` breakage — syntax-check every
    inline script AND load the page. Normalise documented return shapes before chaining
    `.then()/.catch()` or iterating (return-shape drift). Guard async init (DB/worker/model/adapter)
    so controls can't run before ready (init races). Re-check accessible names after every rerender.
    The full catalogue is the "Mandatory anti-regression cases" list in the showcase-auto-research
    SKILL — treat it as build rules, not just review rules.
11. **Verify VISUALLY and with FRESH evidence, not just DOM/console text.** Capture a full-page
    screenshot before and after the primary interaction (plus mobile width when layout changes) and
    inspect geometry: popover/tooltip adjacency to its invoker, `shape-outside` text wrapping on the
    promised side, no gradient/content bleed, no clipped/overlapping controls, and computed
    foreground/background contrast on every code/status/output surface. Clicks, DOM snapshots, and a
    clean console cannot see wrong geometry or low contrast. Reload from disk after your FINAL edit
    and repeat the whole control sequence — evidence captured before the last source change is
    invalid.

Every time you decide to write a folder, the path MUST be `v<N>/<slug(listing_name)>` where N is the
milestone whose listing returned the feature.

## Durable demo compatibility contract — stable URLs · additive evolution · non-destructive

Every **published** demo's identity is a durable compatibility contract. "Published" means it is
live to users: it has a real route/URL and a catalogue entry (for this repo: a `built` demo, and any
`blocked`/unsupported entry that is honestly recorded). A published demo's contract covers its
**route/URL, its slug/ID, the model or platform feature it showcases, its core behavior, its
controls, its use-case intent, and all inbound links.** Routine and agent waves MUST preserve these.

- **Append-only identities.** Published slugs/IDs/routes are append-only. NEVER rename, repurpose,
  replace, merge, or delete an existing published demo because a new wave has a different design
  idea. (Catalogue entries that were never published — e.g. `pending` placeholders with no route —
  are not under contract and may be repointed.)
- **Additive evolution.** A newly discovered use case, interaction concept, model/feature
  composition, presentation approach, or a substantially different demo is added as a NEW page with
  a NEW stable slug + catalogue entry. Do NOT overwrite or repurpose an existing demo to make room.
  Existing basic/practical/wild demos stay available after more ambitious ones are added.
- **In-place fixes only when justified.** Change an existing published demo in place ONLY for a
  demonstrated bug, accessibility/runtime/security issue, factual error, compatibility problem, or
  clear quality improvement. Retain prior behavior/identity unless changing it is necessary; state
  the reason + evidence in the commit message; regression-test the change. Default to the SMALLEST
  patch — never regenerate a working page from scratch when a targeted edit suffices.
- **Moves need a tested alias.** If a URL absolutely must move, keep the old route working via a
  tested permanent redirect/alias recorded in the route manifest. Never silently break a route.
- **Blocked stays recorded.** Unsupported/blocked entries remain honestly recorded (status
  `blocked`), never deleted.
- **Read before editing.** Before editing, read the existing implementation, its history/rationale,
  and the route manifest, then make the smallest change that satisfies the goal.
- **Removals/moves are exceptional.** Any removal, rename, route move, or identity change requires
  an explicit reviewed **migration record** (`MIGRATIONS`/`migrations.json`) and must pass the route
  regression gate. Stable does NOT mean frozen — improve existing demos when justified, and add new
  demos/use cases freely; just never replace an old one merely to present a new idea.

**Gate before every push:** run the route regression gate (`deno task check-routes`). It compares
the previously published manifest against the working tree and fails on any missing published ID,
deleted route, renamed/repurposed slug, changed published identity, or unexplained concept-count
reduction — while allowing additive entries, honest `blocked` records, and in-place fixes.
Exceptional removals/moves must be listed in the migration record with reason + evidence.

**In chrome-platform-showcase specifically:** the catalogue is the `v<N>/<feature-slug>/` filesystem
tree — every `v<N>/<feature-slug>/index.html` is a published feature demo whose stable identity is
the ChromeStatus feature id linked from its index (concept demos live in
`v<N>/<feature-slug>/<concept-slug>/`; a `blocked` feature carries a `_status.json` marker). Emit
the route manifest with `deno task route-manifest` (or `node scripts/route-manifest.mjs`) and run
the gate with `deno task check-routes` (or `node scripts/check-routes.mjs`) before every push.
Record any exceptional removal/rename/move/identity-change in `migrations.json`
(`{ id, action, from, to, reason, evidence, date }`); a `move`/`alias` there also keeps the old URL
alive via the 301 redirect in `routes/aliases.ts`, and the committed `.route-manifest.baseline.json`
is the offline fallback baseline. This matters most for **incomplete** features (Step 3): you are
fixing an existing published demo in place — read its implementation, its git history, and the
manifest first, then add the missing concepts as NEW slugs; never rename or regenerate the existing
published route/concepts to make room.

## Toolset & verification environment (READ — this is how you run standalone in the cloud)

The remote cron routine runs with a limited toolset: **Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep** — NO
`chrome-devtools-mcp`, NO WebFetch, NO WebSearch. Historically this meant the routine built blind
and a later manual sweep caught the defects. That ends here: do the research and verification with
the tools you DO have.

- **Research (Step 5c) via `curl`.** The chromestatus detail gives you the reference URLs — `curl`
  each one. For Chromium source, use gitiles raw (curl-able), e.g. the real flag list:
  `curl -s "https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/runtime_enabled_features.json5?format=TEXT" | base64 -d | grep -i "<Name>"`.
  Search code/issues/CLs via their URLs where curl returns useful text; when a page is a JS app that
  curl can't render, fall back to the spec/explainer/MDN text you can fetch. Best-effort is fine —
  the point is to ground the demo in real material, not to hit every source.
- **Verification via headless Chrome + Read.** You have no `chrome-devtools-mcp`, so drive Chrome
  from Bash: `deno task start` in the background, then a headless run to capture DOM and a
  SCREENSHOT, e.g.
  `google-chrome --headless=new --screenshot=/tmp/shot.png --window-size=1280,2000 --dump-dom "http://localhost:3000/v<N>/<feature>/<concept>/" > /tmp/dom.html`
  (use `chromium`/`chromium-browser` if that's the binary; Canary when the milestone needs it). Then
  **`Read /tmp/shot.png`** to inspect geometry/contrast visually and grep `/tmp/dom.html` for the
  expected state. For interaction, script it with a small headless Puppeteer/`deno`+CDP snippet run
  via Bash, or at minimum load the post- interaction state via a URL param / autorun hook and
  screenshot that. Reading the screenshot image IS your visual gate (rule 11) — a clean DOM dump is
  not enough.
- **If a step's tool genuinely isn't in the environment**, do the best-available check via Bash and
  say so in the summary — do NOT silently skip verification, and do NOT claim a browser-verified
  result you didn't produce. When run from a LOCAL session that DOES have `chrome-devtools-mcp`,
  prefer it over headless Bash.

## Step 1: Setup

Fresh checkout of PaulKinlan/chrome-platform-showcase. Configure git author:

```bash
git config user.email 'paul.kinlan@gmail.com'
git config user.name 'Paul Kinlan'
```

Note Unix time at start. Soft 90-minute budget. The cron fires once a day; the next run continues
where this one stops. Better to leave features behind (deeply-researched, correct demos) than to
corrupt a half-written folder or ship shallow ones — depth beats throughput.

## Step 2: Get current channels

```bash
curl -s https://chromestatus.com/api/v0/channels | tail -c +6 > /tmp/channels.json
```

Strip `)]}'\n`. `prev_stable = stable.mstone - 1`. Build order: prev_stable → stable → beta → dev.
Within each, prefer features with the richest reference material.

## Step 2b: Backfill scope (v130 → prev_stable - 1)

After exhausting fresh work in the current channels, do **backfill** for older releases too. Iterate
milestones from `prev_stable - 1` down to `130`. Within each, classify with Step 3's three states
and pick up **pending AND incomplete** features (do not skip a folder just because it exists — a
thin demo is unfinished work). No per-run cap on backfill — just do the work until the 90-minute
soft budget is up. The whole point is to clear the gap and deepen thin demos.

## Step 3: List candidates per milestone

```bash
curl -s "https://chromestatus.com/api/v0/features?milestone=N" | tail -c +6 > /tmp/features-N.json
```

Iterate every category in `features_by_type`. **Deduplicate by chromestatus feature ID** (a feature
can appear in more than one status section; one demo satisfies the ID). For each unique feature,
save the milestone N and the listing `name`. Slug from that name (lowercase, NFD-normalise, drop
combining marks, runs of non-[a-z0-9] → `-`, strip ends, truncate to 80). Skip Removed/Deprecated.

**Classify each feature into one of three states — folder-existence is NOT enough** (this is how the
routine runs standalone and stops leaving thin demos behind):

- **implemented** — `v<N>/<slug>/index.html` exists AND it has ≥2 interactive concept subfolders AND
  the mandatory `chromestatus.com/feature/<id>` link. Skip these.
- **pending** — no `v<N>/<slug>/index.html`. Build from scratch.
- **incomplete** — folder exists but is thin: only 1 concept (or fewer than the Step 5c use-case
  list found), a static code-card with no real interaction, a missing chromestatus link, or an open
  `major`/`moderate` question in a sibling `_questions.json`. **Treat incomplete the same as
  pending: add the missing concepts / fix the gap in place.** Do not skip a folder just because it
  exists.

Both pending and incomplete features go in the build queue.

## Step 4: Build budget

No per-run cap. Current channels first, then backfill. **Build every distinct use case the API has.
No ceiling.** 2-3 concepts is the floor, not the cap — if the spec / planning discussion identifies
5 distinct use cases, build 5 concept folders. Each concept hits a distinct angle (different API
surface, different real-world use case, or different failure mode / edge case). The goal is to be
comprehensive and inspire developers (Paul, 2026-05-30) — not to tick a box. 1 concept is a
regression. 2 is the floor. Build them all.

## Step 5: Fetch full detail

```bash
curl -s "https://chromestatus.com/api/v0/features/<id>" | tail -c +6 > /tmp/feature-<id>.json
```

Use the detail for content (summary, motivation, explainer_links, spec_link / standards.spec,
doc_links, sample_links, ff_views / safari_views / web_dev_views (1=Shipping 2=InDev 3=Support
4=Mixed 5=NoSignal 6=Opposed 7=PublicOpposition), browsers.chrome.desktop, browsers.chrome.flag,
browsers.chrome.origintrial, blink_components).

Slug + folder path were already decided in Step 3 from the listing. The H1 is the LISTING name, not
the detail name.

## Step 5b: Runtime telemetry and evidence requirements

Every served demo automatically loads `/public/demo-telemetry.js`. The collector records console
errors/warnings, resource failures, unhandled rejections, clicks/submits, slow interactions,
selected performance events, and page assertions to `/telemetry/demo`. Served demo HTML also emits
report-only Reporting API / CSP report headers to `/telemetry/demo/report`. Use this as a safety
net, not as a replacement for DevTools verification.

Telemetry retrieval is private: `/telemetry/demo/admin` and `/telemetry/demo/events` require HTTP
Basic auth where the password is the `showcase_password` (or `SHOWCASE_PASSWORD`) environment
variable. Event ingestion stays open to demo pages but is schema-validated, size-limited, and
rejects obvious cross-site submissions using `Origin` / `Sec-Fetch-Site`.

When adding or changing a demo:

- add `window.showcaseTelemetry?.assert("short-contract-id", condition, details)` for the primary
  feature contract and any important fallback branch;
- make console output intentional and avoid noisy `console.error` / rejected promise paths;
- check `/telemetry/demo/events?limit=25` after DevTools testing and treat unexpected `error` events
  or `assert.fail` events as blockers;
- if the demo needs permission/hardware/user activation, assert the real success path separately
  from the unsupported or denied fallback path;
- keep telemetry payloads privacy-safe: no typed field values, tokens, exact user content, or large
  blobs.

## Step 5c: Deep feature research — follow the links, read the source (do this before Step 6)

The chromestatus summary is a starting point, not the spec. Robust demos come from reading the real
material. For each feature, spend the research budget here so the concepts are comprehensive and the
probes are exact:

1. **Follow every reference.** Fetch and read each `spec_link` / `standards.spec`, every
   `explainer_links` / initial proposal, every `doc_links`, and every `sample_links`. Then follow
   the onward links those pages contain (MDN, web.dev, WPT, GitHub explainer repos). The exact IDL
   member, CSS grammar/values, the capability enum vocabulary, and the enumerated use-case list
   usually live on these pages — not in the summary.
2. **Enumerate distinct use cases.** From that reading, write down the feature's distinct use cases
   and edge/failure modes. This list sets how many concept folders to build (Step 4: no ceiling). If
   the spec describes five distinct capabilities, that is five concepts.
3. **Search for more.** Run follow-on web searches ("<feature> use case", "<feature> MDN",
   "<feature> web.dev", "<feature> example") to find real-world uses and gotchas the spec omits.
4. **Read the actual Chromium implementation.** Ground the demo in how Chrome really behaves:
   - Code search: `https://source.chromium.org/search?q=<term>` (search the IDL name, the CSS
     keyword, the `blink_components` value from the detail). This reveals the real behaviour and
     edge cases.
   - Issues: `https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=<term>` — known bugs, intended behaviour, status.
   - Open CLs / tests: `https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/status:open+-is:wip` and, for the
     web-platform-tests that pin the exact contract,
     `https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/status:open+-is:wip+<term>+test`. The WPT/CL tests
     are the most precise statement of what the feature must do — mirror those expectations in the
     demo and in any conformance suite.
5. **Get the EXACT flag name** (needed for Step 6 flag handling and the user banner). If the
   detail's `browsers.chrome.flag` is set, or the feature is experimental, find the real runtime
   flag in `third_party/blink/renderer/platform/runtime_enabled_features.json5` via
   source.chromium.org (search the feature name). That `name:` value is what goes in
   `--enable-blink-features=<Name>` and what the banner tells the user. Do not guess the flag; look
   it up.

Record, in the feature index or a comment, the use-case list and the exact API surface / flag you
found, so the reviewer and the next run can see the research that grounded the demo.

## Step 6: Design demos — interactive only, no exceptions

**Every concept demo must be interactive.** A static code-card (snippet + blurb + no UI) is NOT a
concept demo and is unacceptable. If you can't make the feature interactive on a page in 5 minutes,
slow down and figure out how — don't ship a card. Use the right interaction for the feature type:

**Prefer real execution over simulation.** The primary button should call the actual browser API,
fetch the actual server route, inspect the real response/header/policy/timing entry, or run the real
replacement API. Do not call a page a "simulator" unless the underlying platform surface is
impossible to exercise from a static showcase page; in that case add a real capability probe first,
show the exact missing prerequisite, and never log a fake success. For auth, payments, FedCM,
WebAuthn, storage access, Privacy Sandbox, and permission-policy demos, this is especially strict:
real `navigator.credentials.*`, `PublicKeyCredential.*`, `PaymentRequest`,
`document.requestStorageAccess`, permissions-policy, and server-header probes first; explanatory
state diagrams second.

- **CSS features** → live stage + toggle/slider/before-after that changes the rendered output as the
  visitor interacts.
- **DOM / JS features** → a try-it button that actually invokes the API and shows the result.
  Feature-detect and degrade gracefully if the API isn't shipped yet on the visitor's browser.
- **HTTP / header / MIME / cache / redirect / network features** → use the Deno server. Add a route
  under the feature folder (e.g. `v<N>/<slug>/echo`) in `server.ts` that responds with the relevant
  header / redirect / content-type behaviour. The concept page fetches from that route and surfaces
  the negotiated outcome. ROUTINE NOTE: you are fenced out of top-level files; for server-route
  demos, generate the feature index + concept page using the path you'd want, and add a one-line
  TODO in the feature index referencing the route name + behaviour so the human reviewer can wire it
  in `server.ts`. Do NOT skip the feature and do NOT downgrade to a static card.
- **Origin trial / behind-a-flag features** → ship the interactive demo, and prefer the FLAG path
  over origin-trial framing, because a flag lets anyone (and you) run the demo for real today. In
  the banner, give the EXACT, copyable enable steps you found in Step 5c — in priority order:
  1. the specific `chrome://flags/#<id>` entry if one exists;
  2. else `--enable-blink-features=<Name>` using the real `runtime_enabled_features.json5` name;
  3. else `--enable-features=<Name>` for a Chromium (non-Blink) feature;
  4. `--enable-experimental-web-platform-features` as the catch-all;
  5. and, only additionally, "or join the origin trial" with the OT link. Then actually TEST behind
     the flag: relaunch Chrome/Canary via `chrome-devtools-mcp` with the flag enabled and verify the
     real success path, not just the fallback. If the API is still absent, show "not available" plus
     the attempted call payload and the exact missing prerequisite — never a fake success path, and
     never blame it on browser age alone (rule 10).
- **OS-specific / device-specific features** → feature-detection probe AND a before-vs-after
  rendered comparison where the difference is visual.
- **Removals / deprecations** → feature-detection probe ("X removed in this browser? yes/no") paired
  with a working example of the replacement API.

Name each concept with a short evocative title. Slug it with the same rules.

## Step 7: Build the files

Folder: `v<N>/<feature-slug>/{index.html, <concept-1>/index.html, ...}`. `<N>` and `<feature-slug>`
are NOT negotiable.

Every HTML file: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/public/styles.css">`. Use the shared classes
(`.lede-block`, `.eyebrow`, `.lede`, `.crumbs`, `.demo-card`, `.demo-list`, `.tag`, `.tag-live`,
`.tag-pending`, `.group-title`, `.byline`).

### Colour and contrast (READ THIS, common bug)

For any per-demo inline `<style>` block:

- **Use CSS variables from public/styles.css for colours.** Available: `--bg-ivory`, `--bg-paper`,
  `--bg-stone`, `--text-black`, `--text-charcoal`, `--text-muted`, `--border-black`,
  `--accent-blue`, `--accent-emerald`, `--accent-rose`. Don't write raw hex codes for text or
  background colours.
- **Every text-on-background pair must hit WCAG AA contrast** (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large
  text). Mentally validate every pair before writing it. Examples that pass: `--text-black` on
  `--bg-ivory` (19.7:1), `--bg-ivory` on `--text-black` (19.7:1), `--text-charcoal` on `--bg-ivory`
  (12.9:1), `--text-muted` on `--bg-paper` (5.7:1). Examples that fail: any medium-grey hex like
  #999 with white text (~2.8:1).
- **Common trap**: badges/tags styled with `background: #999; color: #fff;`. This fails AA. Use
  `background: var(--text-black); color: var(--bg-ivory);` or
  `background: var(--bg-stone); color: var(--text-charcoal);` instead.
- **Selected/active button states**: when you flip the parent to dark
  (`background: var(--text-black); color: var(--bg-ivory);`), ALSO write a rule for any nested
  badge/tag elements so they invert correspondingly (e.g.
  `.button.active .badge { background: var(--bg-ivory); color: var(--text-black); }`). Don't leave
  nested elements at their default colours.
- Status colours (green/red/amber) can use `--accent-emerald`, `--accent-rose`, `#b87b00` for amber,
  but only on a near-white background. On a dark background, swap to the lighter complement.

Feature index skeleton:

```

Every feature index MUST include `chromestatus.com/feature/<id>` in references. That's how we
recover from glitches.

Each concept page follows the same shell with crumbs back to the feature index, the demo at the top,
a `<pre><code>` snippet under it, and a 'see also' section. Real working code. No fake screenshots.
Behind-a-flag features get a `.note` block at the top.

## Step 8: Commit per feature, push, move on

Before committing, start the local server and verify each new concept with `chrome-devtools-mcp`:

- Open every concept route in Chrome or Chrome Canary.
- Exercise every button, input, slider, tab, toggle, and "try it" action.
- Confirm each interaction changes the expected DOM, live readout, network result, permission state,
  or fallback banner.
- Inspect console and network logs; fix unhandled errors, failed same-origin demo routes, blank
  states, and stale readouts.
- Verify accessibility: tab through the demo, confirm visible focus, check that each control has an
  accessible name/label, confirm custom widgets expose correct role/state, and use the Chrome
  DevTools accessibility tree when state is visual-only or ARIA-backed.
- For unsupported, origin-trial, flag-gated, OS-specific, or device-specific features, verify the
  fallback clearly states the missing capability and never reports fake success.

**Anti-regression gate (all must pass before you push — these ARE the standalone-robustness bar):**

1. **Exact-API check** — evaluate the exact advertised probe/API call in the page context and
   compare its real return/exception with the banner and enabled controls. UI claim and real API
   must agree (rules 4, 10).
2. **Visual + geometry** — capture full-page before/after screenshots (plus mobile when layout
   changes) and inspect: popover/tooltip adjacent to invoker, `shape-outside` on the promised side,
   no gradient/content bleed, no clipped/overlapping controls (rule 11).
3. **Contrast** — inspect computed foreground/background on every code/status/output surface; WCAG
   AA (rule 11, invariant 5).
4. **Probe can return false** — no `|| true`, no never-throwing detector, no stale enum catch-all,
   no "upgrade to Chrome N" without ruling out flag/OT/download/hardware/permission/policy (rule
   10).
5. **No crashes** — syntax-check inline scripts, avoid host-global collisions (`top`, `animate`),
   normalise return shapes before chaining, guard async init (rule 10).
6. **Fresh evidence** — reload from disk after your FINAL edit and repeat the whole control
   sequence; evidence from before the last edit is invalid (rule 11).

7. **Route regression gate** — run `deno task check-routes` (or `node scripts/check-routes.mjs`). It
   compares the previously published route manifest (origin/main, falling back to
   `.route-manifest.baseline.json`) against the working tree and must PASS (exit 0). It fails if
   this run deleted/renamed a published route, repurposed a slug's identity, or dropped a feature's
   concept count. New demos are additive and pass automatically; an incomplete-feature fix must keep
   every existing route/concept and only ADD. If you had to intentionally move/remove a published
   route, record it in `migrations.json` with `{ id, action, from, to, reason, evidence, date }`
   before pushing.

If any gate fails, fix the demo and re-run the gate. Do not push a feature without passing all
seven. The full catalogue is the showcase-auto-research SKILL "Mandatory anti-regression cases" —
every item there is a build rule now, not just a review rule.

```bash
git add v<N>/<feature-slug>/
git commit -m "v<N>: build demos for <listing name>

Concepts: <c-1>, <c-2>[, <c-3>]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push
```

One feature per commit. If past 90 minutes, stop.

## Step 9: Uber demo concept issue (only if room)

For each milestone N where ≥3 feature demos exist and there is no open issue titled
`[v<N>] Uber demo concept`, open one. Labels `milestone:<N>`, `uber-demo`, `needs-concept`. Body:
list features, suggest 3 Uber demo concepts combining 3+ features, recommend one.

## Step 10: Summary

Log channels, per-milestone counts, features built (SHA + live URL), stop reason, uber issues.

## Safety

- Never overwrite existing `v<N>/<slug>/`.
- Never edit outside `v<N>/` and `/tmp`. `server.ts`, `lib/`, `public/` are off-limits.
- Run `deno task check-routes` (read-only) before every push; it must PASS. Never destructively
  replace a published route/slug/identity — add new slugs, patch existing demos in the smallest way.
- Pushes go to main. No branches.
- Issues only for Uber demos.
- Respect the 90-minute deadline.
- **Slug from listing name. Milestone from listing position. CSS variables only. WCAG AA contrast.
  No fake simulations. All five inviolable.**
